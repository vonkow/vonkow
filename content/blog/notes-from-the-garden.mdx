There is much dirt in my back yard and a little bit more out front.

I like to plant seeds in it and see what happens.

## Running Notes

### 2021-09-18
Aphids are the current bane of my existence; it is time to reacquaint myself with the smell and application of Neem oil.

The dog, too, has decided to become a force of destruction. New moss planted, new moss dug up; she acts in the blink of an eye.

Thoughts as the summer turns autumnal:
- Starting late has predictable results.
- Aubergine is a tricky oneâ€”it will flower but not go to fruit if the weather is weird.
- If you're going to plant the three sisters, the corn has to get a head start; then, the beans; finally, the squash.
  - Related: Squash does not respect boundaries.
- Things to learn: 
  - Will carrots do anything if planted in mid-september in not-so-sandy soil?
  - How about mustard spinach (which is neither mustard or spinach)?
  - Fava beans?
